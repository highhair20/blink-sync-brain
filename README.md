# Blink Sync Brain

A Raspberry Pi-based system that extends Blink security cameras with face recognition, local video storage, and intelligent video processing. Two Raspberry Pi Zero 2 Ws work together in a dual-role architecture to intercept, analyze, and manage video clips from Blink cameras.

## Overview

Blink cameras don't provide local storage or advanced video analysis. This project solves that by intercepting the Blink Sync Module's USB connection using a virtual USB gadget, capturing clips locally, and running machine learning-based face recognition on a dedicated processor Pi.

## 📖 Getting Started

- **[Hardware & OS Setup](./docs/setup/pi-zero-setup.md)** — Flashing SD cards, first boot, SSH, expand filesystem
- **[Application Setup](./docs/setup/blink-app-setup.md)** — Software install, USB gadget config, processor config, systemd, networking, troubleshooting

### Architecture

| | Pi #1 — Drive (USB Gadget) | Pi #2 — Processor (Video & Face Recognition) |
|---|---|---|
| **Role** | Emulates a USB flash drive to the Blink Sync Module | Processes intercepted video clips and performs face recognition |
| **Key Components** | `USBGadgetManager` | `VideoProcessor`, `FaceRecognitionEngine` |
| **Capabilities** | Virtual 32GB FAT32 drive image, mode switching between Storage Mode (Blink access) and Server Mode (processor access), rsync-over-SSH file transfer, storage monitoring | Frame extraction, face detection and matching against a known-faces database, batch processing, result storage and metadata tracking |

### Data Flow

1. **Capture** — Blink camera records a clip and writes it to what it thinks is a USB drive (actually Pi #1's virtual drive image)
2. **Transfer** — Pi #1 switches to Server Mode so Pi #2 can access new clips
3. **Process** — Pi #2 extracts frames, runs face detection/recognition against the known-faces database
4. **Notify** — Known faces are logged; unknown faces trigger notifications (email, Pushbullet, or webhooks)
5. **Cleanup** — Old clips are automatically removed based on configurable retention policies (default: 30 days, 80% storage threshold)

### Key Technologies

- **Python 3.8+** with async architecture
- **face_recognition** + **OpenCV** for video/image processing
- **TensorFlow Lite** for edge ML inference
- **structlog** for structured JSON logging
- **YAML configuration** with environment variable overrides
- **systemd services** for automatic startup on each Pi

## 🚀 Features

- **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W Integration**: Dual Pi setup for USB gadget mode and video processing
- **Local Video Storage**: Virtual USB drive for Blink Sync Module storage
- **Face Recognition**: Advanced face detection and recognition using machine learning
- **Video Processing**: Automated video analysis, stitching, and management
- **Intelligent Storage**: Smart cleanup and retention policies
- **Real-time Notifications**: Alert system for unknown faces and events
- **Notifications**: Alert system for unknown faces via email, Pushbullet, or webhooks

## 🍓 Roles and CLIs

- Pi #1 Drive CLI: `blink-drive`
  - `blink-drive setup|start|stop|status`
- Pi #2 Processor CLI: `blink-processor`
  - `blink-processor start|status|process-video <file>`

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# On Pi #1 (Drive)
pip install .[drive]
sudo cp scripts/drive/systemd/blink-drive.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable --now blink-drive

# On Pi #2 (Processor)
pip install .[processor]
sudo cp scripts/processor/systemd/blink-processor.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable --now blink-processor

# Ad-hoc processing on Pi #2
blink-processor process-video /path/to/video.mp4 --output-dir /var/blink_storage/results
```
